### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**JohannHugon/JohannHugon** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ğŸ”­ I am currently working on packet processing in high speed network.
- ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning the Rust language and P4.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about GNU\Linux, Wireshark, Arch Linux and other open source stuff!
